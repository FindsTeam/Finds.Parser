# Finds Parser

This is a set of parsers designed to scrap free events from sites that publish event announcements.

## Getting started

Clone project to your computer.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/FindsTeam/Finds.Landing.git
```

### Prerequisites

To start with Finds Parser code, you should have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed.

### Installing

Install all dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

You should create a `.env` file in a root directory. The file should contain:

```
MONGODB_CONNECTION = 
TIMBER_SOURCE_ID = 
TIMBER_API_KEY = 
FACEBOOK_USERNAME =
FACEBOOK_PASSWORD =
```

* `MONGODB_CONNECTION` - a MongoDB [connection string](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) with credentials;
* `TIMBER_ ...` - Environmental variables for [Timber](https://docs.timber.io/). Log better!
* `FACEBOOK_ ...` - Facebook credentials. Event data is no longer available for non-authenticated users üò≠

### Launching

To start parser locally just start `index.js` file from the root folder.

```
$ node index.js
```

or

```
$ npm run dev
```

`dev` script from `package.json` is designed for development needs. It uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to rebuild the code after saving. Strongly recommend to build the application and to run it using `start` script:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Built With

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) - JavaScript runtime for server;
- [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) - Package manager for JavaScript;
- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - A bundler for JavaScript;
- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - Pre-commit & pre-push hooks for Git;
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) - Automatic headless Chromium crawler for Node.js;
- [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) - A general natural language facility for Node.js;
- [Timber](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js) - Node / Javascript Logging;
- [moment](https://github.com/moment/moment/) - Best JS library for time manipulations!

### Database

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL Database;
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - ODM for MongoDB.

## Hints

- Puppeteer should be run in a headless mode if deployed using Heroku;
- Running several instances of Chromium on a free Heroku plan could be dangerous. Make sure you terminate processes correctly;
- Procfile with echo command on 'web' process could be handy if you want to run only scheduled tasks;
- Heroku slug size could be reduced using [heroku-repo addon](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo).
